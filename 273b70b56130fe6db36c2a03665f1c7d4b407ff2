      "message": "This is horrible. Module scripts can be declared as a string, that\u0027s a documented interface. Requiring these to be arrays is just asking for trouble, silent errors and headaches. I\u0027d say there\u0027s a good chance it took a while to figure out why some of the Flow tests weren\u0027t working before you converted those to arrays as well in Flow.php. Either way, that will happen in the future, I guarantee it. If you really want to go with a subset of the ResourceLoader interface, throw an error if it\u0027s not an array.",
