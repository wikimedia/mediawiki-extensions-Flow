That one will do:\n\n    $rev \u003d new Revision( $row );\n\nWhich in turn will check a lot of core rev_* properties that it assumes will be there.\n\nWe should probably change this exception to a warning, since ContribsPager::formatRow() will do a wfSuppressWarnings() right before attempting to create a revision object.",
