      "message": "Any reason this can\u0027t be namespaced like the rest of the code? Echo just does new $class with whatever name is passed, it should(i didn\u0027t explicitly test, but have used the general idea before) work fully namespaced.\n\nThere may be other bugs though, if there are bugs in echo related to namespaced formatters its probably prudent to keep this as is.",
