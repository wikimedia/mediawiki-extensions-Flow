It looks like the reason they are not is because they are multiple levels deep. The above call to buildResult() + buildEmptyResult() only takes the keys from the empty result that don\u0027t exist in buildResult, so these links output by buildEmptyResult would have been overwritten.\n\nI wonder if we should just do an array_merge_recursive instead, but thats probably another patch.
