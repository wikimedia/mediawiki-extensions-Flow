Once we get to that, we should probably add in some paging.\n\nRight now, the $history is pulled in Topic.php. We should add paging \u0026 limit in there, to make sure $history only has a certain number of revisions.\n\nThen nothing should have to change in all of this code (other than adding previous/next links)",
