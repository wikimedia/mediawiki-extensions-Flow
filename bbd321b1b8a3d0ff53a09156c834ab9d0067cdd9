      "message": "Just because the default config makes it so that the exact same group of people have permissions to close \u0026 hide, does not mean that people that have close permissions should also be able to hide.\n\nBy that, I mean that I can imagine smaller wikis with less moderation levels, where noone would have permissions to hide (e.g. only use delete \u0026 suppress), yet want to enable people to close topics. If we allow people with flow-close permissions to also hide, that won\u0027t be possible.\n\nI would not even consider closing a topic a \"moderation event\" and would not apply any of the moderation permissions here.",

At that point, the topic is no longer closed \u0026 people with hide permissions can still see it \u0026 comment again. If the topic is later unhidden, it is still not closed anymore.\n\nPersonally, I think this is unexpected, but perhaps my view is wrong :)",

      "message": "You are right about close \u0026 hide.  The problem is that we don\u0027t want to add another field just for \u0027close\u0027, which would also needs another field to track user_id/user_ip/user_wiki.  \u0027hide\u0027 is actually not a moderation state either, it\u0027s just a status.  My understanding is that we will eventually revamp moderation/status for better support in rev delete, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea to do all the refactoring in here.\n\nTo avoid this problem before we have multi-status support.  We would only allow users to close a topic if the topic is not hidden/deleted/suppressed and no action is allowed when a topic is closed.",
