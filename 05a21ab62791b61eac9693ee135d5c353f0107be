      "message": "The EditorControlsWidget code doesn\u0027t pass any parameters. This works by accident because empty string is substituted for $1 and {{GENDER:|Foo|Bar}} uses the current user.\n\nRelying on {{GENDER:|...}} is fine, but in that case we shouldn\u0027t pretend $1 is passed. This is already and issue with the non-anonymous version of this message, so that\u0027s not this change\u0027s fault, but here you\u0027re adding a new message with an unused $1 parameter and adding a qqq that claims $1 has a certain value.\n\nOr is this a case where $1 needs to be the gender of the user you\u0027re replying to? In that case the problem is not with the message but with the code.",

      "message": "I see the point, but two counter points about this:\n1. First, we actually may not need gender here at all, since these messages only appear to anonymous users who have no gender preference.\n2. Even if some languages have the \"reply\" text relate to the person you are replying to, this is going to be extremely confusing. Our nesting system sometimes means that the reply link you clicked is not necessarily the actual context you are replying to. Even if we find a good solid way to know which user to reference in that case, I think it has a huge potential of actually becoming confusing to the user.\n\nI think we should actually remove the {{GENDER}} from this message completely, since it won\u0027t matter for anonymous users anyways.",
