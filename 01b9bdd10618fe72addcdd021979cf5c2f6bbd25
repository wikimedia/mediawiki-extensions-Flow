      "message": "This returns Deferred in the failure case, and Promise in the success case.  Promise is a strict sub-set of deferred,  its a bit of an inconsistency, but i don\u0027t know how much it matters.\n\nSince Promise is a strict subset, should we mark everything as returning Promises? Note i havn\u0027t looked at the rest of the patch yet so i\u0027m not sure if returning promise is valid in all cases we expect these to return deferred\u0027s.",
