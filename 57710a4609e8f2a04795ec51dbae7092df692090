      "message": "This line is where the \"undefined index -1\" errors in the tests are coming from. Apparently $existingRoots is empty, so count($existingRoots) is 0. This happens in a bunch of test cases (21 of them), but the failures are sprinkled in between successes (there\u0027s one cluster of 7 successive failing tests and another cluster of 2, but the other 12 failures are separated from each other by 2-3 successes each) which suggests that there\u0027s a certain kind of data pattern that causes $existingRoots to be empty.",
