(aside, I wonder how we could best write tests against these templates to assert our logic does what we want).\n\nThe goal here is to handle the following circumstances:\n\nThe content of the post has never changed.  It may or may not have been moderated(\u003e1 revision):  5 minutes ago\n\nThe content of the post has been edited, and the most recent edit was by the original author: Edited 5 minutes ago\n\nThe content of the post has been edited, and the most recent edit was by a user other than the original author: Edited by ErikB 5 minutes ago\n\nThe prime difference vs the merged code is that this compares creator to author, where author may be a user that performed a moderation action(a non-content changing revision).\n\nI\u0027m going to figure out a reasonable way to write tests for this template so we can write out what we mean to display more concretely",
