With \u0027and\u0027/\u0027or\u0027 expressions, logic is naturally terminated early if steps are redundant.\n\nThis also arguably makes the code harder to read. While it may be more natural in languages like C, I think in PHP it\u0027s a bit counter-intuitive to write statements this way unless there\u0027s a good reason to.\n\nSee also T89063.",
