Standalone is for plain html5, not for MW Parsoid html).\n\nI can\u0027t say what you should use instead as I don\u0027t know in what context this is used or what it is for, but I\u0027d recommend contacting the VE team with what you need and we can come up with a solution that we will support (as the below will eventually break in unexpected ways).",
