      "message": "Haha. I was committing a bad version of the script to test itself. I fixed the intentional whitespace problems on-disk, but because I didn\u0027t `git add` the new version, the file that the commit hook verifies is not the version that\u0027s being checked in. This is an actual bug with the commit hook, hmmm. Maybe there\u0027s a way to check the version of the file that\u0027s about to be checked in, but there\u0027s no `git show --cached \"$f\"` option.\n\nNew version won\u0027t have the whitespace error.",
