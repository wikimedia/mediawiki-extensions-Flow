      "message": "we intend to allow topics to be on multiple pages, it looks like we might be investigating that soon.  I\u0027m thinking to facilitate that this should be a nested list of objects like revisions is below, eg:\n\n    \u0027titles\u0027 \u003d\u003e array(\n        \u0027type\u0027 \u003d\u003e \u0027object\u0027,\n        \u0027properties\u0027 \u003d\u003e array(\n            \u0027namespace\u0027 \u003d\u003e ...,\n            \u0027namespace_text\u0027 \u003d\u003e ...,\n            ...\n        ),\n    ),\n\nI know the end result is they get flattened out into what we already have here, as if we submitted a list for each property, but it seems like it would be a bit clearer to generate and maintain?  Headers can still only be one one title, but i suppose for consistency they could still use this config as well.",
