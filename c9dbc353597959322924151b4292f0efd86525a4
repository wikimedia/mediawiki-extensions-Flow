I am excluded from the flow-new-topic notification because of the locateTalkPageOwner filter, and I am also excluded from the flowusertalk-new-topic notification because of the locateUsersWatchingTitle fitler, so I don\u0027t get a notification.\n\nThis pattern is repeated in other notification types below.",
