      "message": "Do we want this logic?  When $wgFlowForceTemplateRecompile is false, if someone forgets to compile a rarely-used template, a production server will attempt it. The file_put_contents() below will probably fail (?), but should it succeed we will silently be incurring that unexpected operation on NNN production servers, and running un-tested generated PHP in production.\n\nMaybe if forceRecompile is false and the compiled file doesn\u0027t exist, output a wfDebugLog( \u0027Flow\u0027 , \"Compiled version of template $templateName not found, attempting to compile\" ).  And/or we could have another variable $wgFlowNeverCompileTemplates, or the existing variable could be a tri-state true, false, \u0027never\u0027.",
