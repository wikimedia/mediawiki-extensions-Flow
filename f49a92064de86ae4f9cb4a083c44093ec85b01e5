      "message": "Not new in this commit, but... this function is doing some weird stuff.\n\n$content is re-used later for the returned html string (as opposed to a Content object).\n\nAnd in case of the format\u003dhtml path (the default behaviour), $content\u0027s first value is unused, so this should probably moved to within the else case (unless you\u0027re relying on some kind of side effect as a result of calling getContent).\n\nAnd below if the exception happens, $content is left in an odd state, not sure what it\u0027ll return. I\u0027d expect $content to be assigned in the catch-block.",
