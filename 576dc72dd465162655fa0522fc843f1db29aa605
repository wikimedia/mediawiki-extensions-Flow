The hiding and showing of this should be handled via a parent class name OR template re-rendering.\n\nIn addition, because this was added to so many files, it\u0027s probably better to be a subtemplate. That way, any changes can be made to one location instead of several.\n\nThis applies to all the files this line was added to.",
