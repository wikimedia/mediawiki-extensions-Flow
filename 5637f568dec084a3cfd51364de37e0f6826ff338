      "message": "We should probably come up with some level of guidelines for when something is an exception, and when its an error we should just log.  I suppose complicating that is that in some cases we catch and log the errors.\n\nIn this case my thinking is that this is a fairly rare and should only happen when adding new revision types.  Its a rare enough occurrence that i would prefer it to blow up visibly rather than just logging a message.",
