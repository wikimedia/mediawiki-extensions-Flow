Initially flow will just be a users talk page replacement, but will grow to support many other
workflows.  Flow must support multiple objects of the same workflow originating from the same 
wiki page. One example of this is a Request for Deletion,  which has any number of historical 
closed rfd's and at most 1 active rfd. Another is a Users Board, which can have any number of
Topic workflows open or closed.

All workflows will be allowed to have closed historical flow objects.  The URL's to view these 
historical workflows will, like wiki revisions, require the full object id in the URL.

All workflows will be allowed to be marked with either Unique, or Not-Unique.

Unique workflows, like the discussion, will be addressable simply by going to an occupied page:

/User talk:Zomg

redirects to default workflow:

/User talk:Zomg?workflow=discussion

It is expected that unique workflows will be used as a container for the non-unique workflows, 
any URL refering to a non-unique workflow must, like closed objects, contain the object id.

How to address non-unique objects within a unique workflow?

/User talk:Zomg?objectId=12345

This feels sucky,  

For example, Topics within a discussion.  When a user submits the reply form it should submit
to the page the user is already viewing, so that error messages can be rendered to the same page
the user was already viewing.  On success, the user
