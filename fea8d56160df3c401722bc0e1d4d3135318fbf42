Therefore, I make an effort to not remove any old handlers for no reason when it\u0027s as simple as a tiny 3 line addition.\n\nSure, another JS file might not be as considerate as this one in checking for previous handlers, but it *is* the de-facto standard operating procedure.\n\nI\u0027ll leave it as-is.",
