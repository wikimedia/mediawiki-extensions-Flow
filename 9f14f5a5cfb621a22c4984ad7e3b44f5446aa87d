      "message": "This method has lost the internal caching, which is to prevent duplicated conversions between binary and alphadecimal.\n\nWhat if instead of all the \n\n    new static( $input, static::INPUT_*)\n\nyou set a \n\n    $type \u003d static::INPUT_*;\n\nThen later you can do\n\n    $key \u003d \"$type-$input\";\n    $uuid \u003d self::$cache-\u003eget( $key );\n    if ( $uuid \u003d\u003d\u003d null ) {\n         $uuid \u003d new static( $input, $type );\n        $self:$cache-\u003eset( $key, $uuid );\n    }\n    return $uuid;\n\nperforming a conversion should also populate the cache.  The main worry here is there are parts of the code that create and throw away uuid\u0027s in short order, that uuid will end up being recreated later and we shouldn\u0027t re-do the conversion.",

      "message": "The idea behind this patch is that there should be almost no conversions anymore. The only place where binary ids are used is DB. So only when writing new data to cache should a conversion to binary (from hex) be done, and when read from DB will we convert from binary to alphanumeric.\n\nIf we serialize to alphanumeric, all data in cache will be numeric. That\u0027s how we use it throughout our code too. So a regular page request would (in theory, unless I missed something) read a UUID from cache in alphanumeric format, be used in the code in alphanumeric format, and never need conversion.\n\nSince pretty much the only conversions is when writing to/reading from DB, that conversion should not be done more than once per id per request, so the caching should not be needed.",

      "message": "I suppose my main worry is places like FeatureIndex::cacheKey which has the line\n\n    $attributes[$key] \u003d UUID::create( $attr )-\u003egetAlphadecimal();\n\nThere might be other cases, but this particular one has shown up in profiling a few times.  The caching layer returns database rows which contain the binary uuid representation.  When generating cache keys (say from a TopKIndex returning a list of binary uuids to be re-queried in the UniqueIndex) it does the binary -\u003e alphadecimal conversion, and then we will likely do the same conversion in the output layer.\n\nI\u0027ll re-profile this new code and see how its doing, but my gut feeling is it is still necessary.  The other answer might be do adjust the caching layer to store UUID objects, or the alphadecimal representation.",
