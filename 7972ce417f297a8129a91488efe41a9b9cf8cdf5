      "message": "\"moderated post\" is different from a moderated topic, so the description is wrong.  The actual Scenario is\n\n    Scenario: After reloading a page, no moderated posts appear in any collapse mode.\n\n(I\u0027m not sure this test has much value any more, why not \"The Reply dialog/the board history/a picture of the Taj Majal doesn\u0027t appear when you cycle through collapsing\")\n\n(We need a test that a hidden post has an undo until the page is reloaded, and not for other users. Could do it before the \"Given I am on Flow page\" reloads the page, but the obvious place for that test is in moderation.feature and moderation_anon.feature)",
