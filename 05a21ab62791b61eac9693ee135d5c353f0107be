      "message": "The EditorControlsWidget code doesn\u0027t pass any parameters. This works by accident because empty string is substituted for $1 and {{GENDER:|Foo|Bar}} uses the current user.\n\nRelying on {{GENDER:|...}} is fine, but in that case we shouldn\u0027t pretend $1 is passed. This is already and issue with the non-anonymous version of this message, so that\u0027s not this change\u0027s fault, but here you\u0027re adding a new message with an unused $1 parameter and adding a qqq that claims $1 has a certain value.\n\nOr is this a case where $1 needs to be the gender of the user you\u0027re replying to? In that case the problem is not with the message but with the code.",
