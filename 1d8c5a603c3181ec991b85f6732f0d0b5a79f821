They were previously used, \n\nWithin my recentchanges patch set,  all calls to self::moderate will use the configured message from \u0027comment\u0027 as an i18n message in both recent changes and the post/topic history.\n\nI\u0027ve removed it from here, you can find it now in the recentchanges patch where it belongs :)",
