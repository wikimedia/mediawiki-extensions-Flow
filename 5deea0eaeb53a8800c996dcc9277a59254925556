      "message": "I think thats what we want here,\n\n$dbw-\u003ebegin() should have implicitly closed any transaction that was already open(mysql supports nested transactions via savepoint/rollback to, but apparently mediawiki does not)\n\nThat should mean the only transaction that can possibly be open is our own, unless something inside $callback started its own transaction.  I suppose thats possible, since $callback can be anything, but i would call that a bug to be fixed.",
