Something\u0027s wrong when parsing this via JS, though.\n\nTry triggering new topics to be rendered when not logged in (post new topic/reply; load more): the below link will not be replaced.\n\nI have not yet figured out why exactly (and how to fix it)\n\nIt seems to be related to having nested progressiveEnhancement scripts: when removing the progressiveEnhancement tags in flow_form_buttons.handlebard, this one actually works fine.\n\nI have yet to look into why it\u0027s only happening when not logged in.",

      "message": "Hmm, this is probably due to something using TemplateEngine.processTemplate instead of TemplateEngine.processTemplateGetFragment\n\nGetFragment should be the one to call in 99% of circumstances, but we use the plain call in a few places for unknown reasons.  Going to swap them arround and see if it helps",
