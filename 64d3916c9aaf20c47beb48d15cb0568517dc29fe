      "message": "So, I wanted to change this and store a clone of the object in $this-\u003eloaded, instead of the row. Like:\n\n    $this-\u003eloaded[$object] \u003d clone $object;\n\nI could then defer the -\u003etoStorageRow part until we actually need the row.\n\nHowever, CachingObjectMapper::toStorageRow \u0026 ::fromStorageRow have some checks in place to ensure the data that has gone in there are the same objects.\n\nI could either delete those checks for duplicates (probably undesired - kinda defeats the point of CachingObjectMapper) or add some argument, or whatever other workaround, to allow cloned objects to be passed in regardless (but that just seems nasty)\n\nSee follow-up patch https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/178193/\n\nIdeas? I\u0027m considering just doing the -\u003etoStorageRow here anyway, the computational overhead isn\u0027t *that* big :p",
