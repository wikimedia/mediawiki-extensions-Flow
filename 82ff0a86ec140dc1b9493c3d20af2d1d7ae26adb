For now, though, we\u0027re in a tricky spot where Revision object are unaware of what page they\u0027re on.\n\nCome to think of it, I\u0027m calling this method from withing Block objects, which know about the title, so I can probably make this non-optional already and remove the hack. Let me check :)",
