There will be a few default workflows distributed with flow:


discussion:
	summary - custom table
	topic list - custom table

topic:
	title - custom table
	posts - custom table

and then, each item you create has a unique UUID.

You always refer to flow objects with a page, which must exist -- you cannot create discussions for a page that does not exist.
In the examples below, the "Sandbox" page must have some content.

A board using this workflow can be viewed as the full discussion, or just a topic can be fetched:

View the full discussion:
	/Special:Flow/Sandbox?workflow=<discussionUUID>
or since a discussion is the default workflow and there is only one per page (see BLOCKS, below), just
	/Special:Flow/Sandbox
It is an error to specify the discussionUUID for another page.

View a single topic:
	/Special:Flow/Sandbox?workflow=<topicUUID>

The implicit action is 'action=view', but there are others, for example:

View board history for a page (shows history for all its topics)
	/Special:Flow/Sandbox?action=topic-history

View one topic's history
	/Special:Flow/Sandbox?workflow=<topicUUID>&action=topic-history
View Post history of a reply post to the above:
	/Special:Flow/Sandbox?workflow=<topicUUID>&action=post-history&topic[postId]=<somePostUUID>



BLOCKS( think widget )
------

The prototype for Flow is very simple, all we need to implement is a discussion system.  This will be
slightly complicated by both the top level Discussion and the individual Topic's being "Flow Objects".
To accomplish this we will define 3 types of blocks:

	Summary
	TopicList
	Topic

The blocks will be refered to by 2 individual workflows.
The discussion workflow will be defined as:

	name: discussion
	blocks: [ Summary, TopicList ]
	topic_workflow: discussion-topic
	singleton: true  // Only a single discussion may exist per wiki page
	closeable: false // Discussions are not closeable, they are forever

	view discussion: /Special:Flow/Sandbox?workflow=<discussionUUID>&action=view
	create discussion: /Special:Flow/Sandbox?workflow=<discussionUUID>&action=view

The discussion-topic workflow will be defined as
	name: discussion-topic
	blocks: [ Topic ]
	singleton: false // Multiple discussion-topics may exist per wiki page
	closeable: true  // Topics can be closed to additions

	view topic: /Special:Flow/Sandbox?flow=discussion-topic&action=view&topic=an7imao1jrl8bjq6netpq3oi
	reply to topic: /Special:Flow/Sandbox?flow=discussion-topic&action=view&topic=an7imao1jrl8bjq6netpq3oi
	reply to post: /Special:Flow/Sandbox?flow=discussion-topic&action=reply&post=an7imao1jrl8bjq6netpq3oi
