      "message": "my worry here is that we are doing these mid-stream, as the import happens. The only database transaction we are holding open is against the flow db though, so if an exception is thrown and the topic import is rolled back, the afterPostImported redirects will have been inserted and will point to the wrong UUID.\n\nOne solution would be to queue up work to be done in these listeners, and then have a final commit listener than does the work?",
