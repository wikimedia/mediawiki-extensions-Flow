      "message": "I know this is becoming more difficult because the Templating class is kind of a mess, but I would prefer to take the value of $this-\u003eactions as a constructor parameter.\n\nI\u0027m thinking we could pass the container object into the Templating constructor since its a bit of a god-object currently.  Once templating has a direct reference to the constructor we can pull bits like the post action permissions from the container rather than creating it in the middle of the code.\n\nI know it may seem like a bit of extra work to push (most) global usage out of classes and into container.php, but I think the lack of global state in most of the code really helps with knowing exactly what will happen and what the inputs/outputs of something are.",
