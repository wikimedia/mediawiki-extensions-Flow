      "message": "The html is ignored in this case. But it seems a required property, so does the creator of this sets it anyway?\n\nI guess this is working because the creator also sets a messageKey alongside \u0027details\u0027 which is presumably what eventually ends up getting rendered. Or does error[\u0027details\u0027][\u0027html\u0027] makes its way to the output in another way?",
