      "message": "hmm, i hadn\u0027t considered this interaction, it hapens because the title and first post are separate revisionable items. Based on current UI prototype we need to come up with a history thats not just for a single post, but for an entire thread anyways. Since we will have that i think it will be ok that changing the title of the thread only shows up in the tree history and not the first post history, reasonable?",
