At a minimum we should probably check defined( \u0027MW_PHPUNIT_TEST\u0027 ) before swallowing the exception.\n\nMore importantly though, we need to get these failing tests running in jenkins.  I\u0027m imagining this is due to us not contacting parsoid, perhaps if i find some time i will work on refactoring that so we can use fixtures in unit tests( i submitted a basic patch at https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/191697 but it still has issues and it didn\u0027t seem like i should spend the day figuring them out)",
