Should we set some config option during the opt-in process, and then check if that config option is available in the conditional load? \n\nWe said at first that we\u0027d only set the cookie from the opt in process, but if we want this to load conditionally, we\u0027d have to add some sort of way to recognize it in the back end, no?",

This is the same sort of trick we use for browser tests, too, because there\u0027s real way of figuring out the link in there. In fact, in browser tests, we go further and have the browser trigger a click on it so we can verify that the archive is done correctly.\n\nI agree it\u0027s non reliable, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s that horrific, honestly. The ideal would be to add a class so we can make ti better, but if we think about it, the only scenario this tour (and browser tests) care about the link in the description is when there is only that exact link in the description.\n\nThen again, if we *can* add a class to that link so we can find it, it\u0027s definitely better for both needs.",
