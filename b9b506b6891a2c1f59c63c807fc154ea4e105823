These are already referenced below (PostRevision, Header, PostSummary).\n\nAlso, make sure to check isAllowed as done in Flow/includes/Dump/Exporter.php .  Otherwise, we need to use $templating-\u003egetContent for security/privacy reasons (it is probably safer to the do the latter anyway, though the current exporter does use $revision-\u003egetContent).\n\nYou can get $templating from:\n\n$templating \u003d Flow\\Container::get( \u0027templating\u0027 );",
