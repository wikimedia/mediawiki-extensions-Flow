      "message": "I don\u0027t think it makes sense to multiple the +1 by three.  This basically gives:\n\n3 * ($this-\u003eoptions[\u0027pager_limit\u0027] + 1).\n\nor\n\n3 * $this-\u003eoptions[\u0027pager_limit\u0027] + 3\n\nI think it would be clearer as:\n\n$options[\u0027limit\u0027] \u003d min( self::MAX_LIMIT, 3 * $this-\u003eoptions[\u0027pager_limit\u0027] )\n\nThe +1/+3 is not needed since it\u0027s already enforced by $numNeeded in the loop.",
