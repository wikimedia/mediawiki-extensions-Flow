      "message": "I think just removing .flow-edit-post-form from there would serve the same purpose:\n\n    .flow-post, .flow-reply-form {\n\nThe .flow-edit-post-form was added there because it wouldn\u0027t originally indent, since it was not part of .flow-post. This has since changed, because we can\u0027t replace all of .flow-post (it may have child posts). Right now, the real post content (that is being replaced by the edit form) is inside .flow-post-main \u0026 .flow-post is now also a parent of .flow-edit-post-form \u003d the original reason .flow-edit-post-form is in here, is no longer needed.\n\nNot sure if there are other indents (apart from edit form) that were incorrect so I won\u0027t change the patch yet. A quick look at regular post view, reply \u0026 edit seems to look alright to me with the above change.",
