Otherwise, editing a post will cause the topic to refresh and the editing again will take us to the no-js link to edit in a separate window.",

      "message": "Reply and EditPost are indeed weird because they are centered on actions (replying, editing) rather than objects (post). We could have a Post widget that allows editing. Creating a blank instance could be used for replying and could be contained by the NewTopic widget. Or some variation of it.\n\nCreating a base class would not be my preferred option but I agree that encapsulation of shared behavior could help keep those widgets simple.
