Attempt to document the basic flow of execution through flow:


== Controller ==

TODO: This part is out of date.

Requests are captured by a hook, and an OccupationController determines whether
or not the request should be handled by Flow.

* Figure out which article title the request is asking for.
* Figure out which workflow definition is being used against this article title
* Figure out what type of action is being requested by the user(view/reply/suppress/etc?)
* Use the article title and workflow definition to locate the appropriate flow object
* Provide the article id and the user id to the sharded database implementation
* Create a controller class capable of performing actions for the current workflow 
* Pass execution off to the controller


Most work within flow will be done by Blocks(think widget).  The Controller will:

* Create all the blocks referenced by the definition 
* Apply the users action(ex. edit) to all the blocks, along with appropriate POST data
* If all the blocks accepted the users action then commit the blocks. 
** Issue a redirect to 'view' action after commit
* Render all the blocks 

=== Why? ===

The controller is intended to orchestrate the block implementation.  

The rendering portion should be seperate from the form handling in 

=== What about API calls? ===

Good Question.  Most UI-accessible actions need to be accessible from the API calls.

== Blocks ==

Think of blocks as individual controllers?  They receive an action(request) from a user
and do something with it.  They also provide data to the rendering layer.
