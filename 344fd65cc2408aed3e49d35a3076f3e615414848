      "message": "By doing this, you also truncate the topic titles for languages with multi-byte characters to 25 characters. Please find a way to truncate based on characters, and not on bytes, because it\u0027s bad i18n. Potentially, it can also cause truncation in the middle of a multi-byte character instead of at the end of a character, although that\u0027s fixed in truncate().\n\nIn essence, it\u0027s a bit sad that Language::truncate does truncation based on bytes, and not on characters.",
