But that number is configurable ($wgEchoMaxNotificationCount)\n\nI\u0027m not sure how to best describe that behavior though:\n\n* referencing $wgEchoMaxNotificationCount seems confusing\n* mentioning \"99\" could be incorrect (depending on config)\n\nWhat do you think?",

The fact that it\u0027s not possible to pluralize on whatever n+ is.\n\nWe are taking about this:\n\n $3 {{PLURAL:$4|other|others}}\n\nThat works fine with plurals in all languages as long as $3 is actually a number. However, it is not always. In some cases, $3 will mean \"more than $3\", and $3 is configurable. From that follows, this should be a separate message. What is currently \"$1+\" should basically be a copy of the complete message with \"+\" added after \"$3\".",
