      "message": "not really a part of this patch, but if we are refactoring it might be doing here:\n\nthis workflow id is already available in the metadata that was passed to onAfterInsert(), there should always be a \u0027workflow\u0027 key in the metadata.That would be better than potentially (probably not, but this code path can) doing network requests to locate it.  Its also just plain less code to call.",

      "message": "I\u0027m left wondering if these log params are really best set here, it would seem for consistency they should be set in the ModerationLogger.  The general idea imo is that a listener just wires things together with whatever conditions trigger the behaviour, the the specific object they take in should be the one that has everything necessary to test inputs/outputs against.",
