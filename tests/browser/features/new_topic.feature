Feature: Creating a new topic

  Background:
    Given I am on Flow page

  Scenario: Cannot create a new topic without content
    When I type "Anonymous user topic creation test" into the new topic title field
    Then the Save New Topic button should be disabled

  Scenario: Add new Flow topic as anonymous user
    When I have created a Flow topic with title "Anonymous user topic creation"
    # TODO the terminology below is terrible, posts don't have headings. It's the top topic's title and first post.
    Then the top post should have a heading which contains "Anonymous user topic creation"
      And the top post should have content which contains "Anonymous user topic creation"
