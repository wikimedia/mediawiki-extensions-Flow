      "message": "$cacheKeys will have all cache keys; $keysFromCache will exclude those that have not been resolved via cache, thus saving a couple of elements to be looped over a couple of times.\n\nYou could argue that the most common case is likely that all keys are found in cache, in which case the intersect is just a waste of cpu, but we need some way to check (see line below) if there are unresolved queries left, and this would probably still qualify as the cheapest solution.",
