      "message": "ChangesList::isUnpatrolled will nearly always return false for our entries.\n\nThe first couple of lines in that method are about figuring out if the rc entry is unpatrolled - this is fine.\n\nSecond half, it figures out if the user can see that it\u0027s unpatrolled, by matching either:\n* $user-\u003euseRCPatrol()\n* $user-\u003euseNPPatrol() \u0026\u0026 $rcType \u003d\u003d RC_NEW\n\nuseRCPatrol: User needs \u0027patrol\u0027 or \u0027patrolmarks\u0027 permissions and $wgUseRCPatrol needs to be enabled, which for most production wikis is not the case (see InitialiseSettings.php[1])\n\nuseNPPatrol: Same as above, but also works if $wgUseNPPatrol is enabled. But the rc type can only be RC_NEW (\u003d1)\n\nSo basically, isUnpatrolled will always return false for our Flow entries on most production wikis.\n\n1: https://github.com/wikimedia/operations-mediawiki-config/blob/master/wmf-config/InitialiseSettings.php, L6530",
