      "message": "That was my original idea too.\n\nHowever, the #flow-post-uuid part in the url is used as selector, to find a node #flow-post-uuid or #flow-topic-uuid. From that node, we then fetch the ID: .data( \u0027flow-id\u0027 ).\n\nI assumed there were good reasons for doing so. If not, I\u0027ll just go refactor that to get rid of the \u0027flow-post-\u0027 or \u0027flow-topic-\u0027 prefix and simply toss in the uuid as hash, then use that in the highlighter function. What do you think?\n\nI\u0027d definitely prefer that over this mess.",
