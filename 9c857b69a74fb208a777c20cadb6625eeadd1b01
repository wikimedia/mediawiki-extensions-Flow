      "message": "$this.data doesn\u0027t make any assumptions, beyond that you will call autoExpand with the same `this` multiple times.  Perhaps this comment was supposed to be a couple lines down on L86?\n\nIf you meant L86 i\u0027ve now changed that to just $this.closest( \u0027form\u0027 ),  Since this method expands the height of textarea\u0027s it should be a safe assumption there is a parent form somewhere.",

Basically chrome expands the content inside the textbox and displays that to screen before the javascript is called.
