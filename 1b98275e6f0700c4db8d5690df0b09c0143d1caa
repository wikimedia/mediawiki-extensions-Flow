When this is set the timestamp partial is never loaded, and afaict the timestamp partial is the only source of \u003ctime\u003e elements.\n\ngrepping through the templates i dont see any direct usage of this timestamp helper, only via the uuidTimestamp helper and the time auto-update. I don\u0027t see any calls to uuidTimestamp helper setting timeAgoOnly.  \n\nPerhaps we can kill that argument and just have the auto-update timestamp helper use .text() method against the returned data?",
