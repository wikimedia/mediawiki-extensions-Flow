Only after doing all DB patches are PostDBUpdateMaintenance scripts run.\n\nThis would result in FlowUpdateRevisionType never being run, because the table will have been dropped first.\n\nPerhaps this drop-patch should be executed in FlowUpdateRevisionType maintenance script, to make sure it\u0027s only run after the data is converted?",

If a 3rd party wiki has run it before it wouldn\u0027t get run again, then the table wouldn\u0027t get dropped, but I think this should be fine given this is more minor and we don\u0027t have much 3rd party users.",
