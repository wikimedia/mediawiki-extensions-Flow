      "message": "I don\u0027t know if we\u0027re doing this everywhere always, or whether it was considered on this case in particular. But if \"everywhere\", we might want to reconsider, because it can certainly cause bugs in specific scenarios.\n\nBasically, if one or more parameters is passed-through, they should probably all pass through, and this pattern is great.\n\nWhen, no parameters are passed-through (like here), it seems like technical debt waiting to one-day cause a bug.\n\nIt currently documents no parameters, so any parameters passed would be passed in error. Later, if this class gets a first parameter for local use, it may still be passed to the parent in error.",

      "message": "Yeah, that\u0027s a fair point. I think it comes down to:\n\nAutomatically perform use of X vs Automatically block Y.\n\nWhere each is mutually exclusive.\n\nMy thinking was that  setting up the automation seemed premature.\n\nOf course, anyone can make mistakes, e.g. renaming a private property without updating the references. That can always happen, but my belief is that it\u0027s more likely that one remembers to update the class X\u0027s constructor when adding a parameter to that same constructor, compared to remembering to update subclass(es) when making a commit that only changes the parent to have an extra parameter.",
