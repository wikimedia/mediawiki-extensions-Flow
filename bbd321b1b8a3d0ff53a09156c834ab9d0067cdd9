If we allow people with flow-close permissions to also hide, that won\u0027t be possible.\n\nI would not even consider closing a topic a \"moderation event\" and would not apply any of the moderation permissions here.",

At that point, the topic is no longer closed \u0026 people with hide permissions can still see it \u0026 comment again. If the topic is later unhidden, it is still not closed anymore.\n\nPersonally, I think this is unexpected, but perhaps my view is wrong :)",
