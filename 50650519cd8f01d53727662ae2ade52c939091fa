We then have to re-initialize the node too (re-bind stuff etc)\n\nhttps://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/105674/7/modules/discussion/post.js - L181\n\nThere, flow_init is called on $container, which _is_ .flow-post node itself. Without .addBack, it wouldn\u0027t find the node and wouldn\u0027t initialise again.\n\nThat too, should probably change some day - we probably shouldn\u0027t just .trigger( \u0027flow_init\u0027 ) on any given DOM node and have it initialize whatever it finds inside :p",
