There will be a few default workflows distributed with flow:


discussion:
	summary - custom table
	topic list - custom table

topic:
	title - custom table
	posts - custom table


A discussion can be viewed as the full discussion, or just a topic can be fetched:


View the full discussion:
	/Flow:Special/User:Zomg&flow=discussion

View a single topic:
	/Flow:Special/User:Zomg&flow=topic&name=an7imao1jrl8bjq6netpq3oi



BLOCKS( think widget )
------

The prototype for Flow is very simple, all we need to implement is a discussion system.  This will be
slightly complicated by both the top level Discussion and the individual Topic's being "Flow Objects".
To accomplish this we will define 3 types of blocks:
	
	Summary
	TopicList
	Topic

The blocks will be refered to by 2 individual workflows.
The discussion workflow will be defined as:

	name: discussion
	blocks: [ Summary, TopicList ]
	topic_workflow: discussion-topic
	singleton: true  // Only a single discussion may exist per wiki page
	closeable: false // Discussions are not closeable, they are forever

	view discussion: /Special:Flow/User:Zomg?flow=discussion&action=view
	create discussion: /Special:Flow/User:Zomg?flow=discussion&action=view

The discussion-topic workflow will be defined as
	name: discussion-topic
	blocks: [ Topic ]
	singleton: false // Multiple discussion-topics may exist per wiki page
	closeable: true  // Topics can be closed to additions
	
	view topic: /Special:Flow/User:Zomg?flow=discussion-topic&action=view&topic=an7imao1jrl8bjq6netpq3oi
	reply to topic: /Special:Flow/User:Zomg?flow=discussion-topic&action=view&topic=an7imao1jrl8bjq6netpq3oi
	reply to post: /Special:Flow/User:Zomg?flow=discussion-topic&action=reply&post=an7imao1jrl8bjq6netpq3oi
