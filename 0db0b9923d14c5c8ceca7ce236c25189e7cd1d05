Attempt to navigate away; you should get a confirmation dialog but I think you won\u0027t\n\nThis is a bit crazy though, and if this turns out to be correct then there should definitely be a comment explaining why this code is here.\n\n(Also, yes, I;m the one that wrote this originally, I apologize.)",
