      "message": "According to Danny Horn:\n\n@jonrobson1 Yeah, this is new terminology that applies to this feature only. We\u0027re not making a change sitewide from watching to subscribing -- article and talk pages etc will still be using watching/watchlist.\n\nThe big difference between subscribing to a topic and watching a talk page is that you can subscribe to some topics on a Flow board and not others, and you\u0027ll get notifications for those individual topics. Watchlist is page-level only.\n\n(If there is an issue with this I\u0027d suggest bringing it up on the Flow mediawiki discussion board or the mailing list or come chat with us in irc)",
