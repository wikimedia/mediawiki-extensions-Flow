I dunno, i\u0027m ok with a merge just confused.",

      "message": "Nah, the issue is with the *Parsoid* response. The response from Parsoid doesn\u0027t have a specified charset (I suspect actually that it does have one, but it\u0027s in the HTTP headers rather than in the HTML), so our parsing with DOMDocument is munging the UTF-8 characters because it thinks that it\u0027s ISO-whatever it is",
