This stuff should be set on data-flow-* attributes. It\u0027s a correction we can make later, just please put a @todo here about that.\n\nYou\u0027ll notice apart from reinitializeBoard (and a couple of in-development methods), none of flow-board.js does any handling of elements by direct class name, except when they are interactivity class names (eg. flow-form-collapsible).",
