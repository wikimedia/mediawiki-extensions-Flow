Feature: Topic collapsing

  Background:
    Given I am logged in
      And I am on Flow page

      And I create a Non-Moderated Topic in Flow new topic
      And I create a Initial post of Non-Moderated Topic into Flow body
      And I click New topic save

      And I create a Hidden Topic in Flow new topic
      And I create a Initial post of Hidden Topic into Flow body
      And I click New topic save
      And I click the Topic Actions link
      And I click the Hide topic button
      And I give reason for hiding as being "Test collapsing moderated posts"
      And I click Hide topic
      And I do not see the dialog box

  Scenario: Small topics view
    Given I am on Flow page
    When I switch from Topics and posts view to Small topics view
      And the page has re-rendered
    Then I should see the title of the first non-moderated topic
      And I should not see who started the first non-moderated topic
      And I should not see the comments of the first non-moderated topic

  Scenario: Topics only view
    Given I am on Flow page
    When I switch from Topics and posts view to Topics only view
      And the page has re-rendered
    Then I should see the title of the first non-moderated topic
      And I should see who started the first non-moderated topic
      And I should not see the comments of the first non-moderated topic

  Scenario: Topics and posts view
    Given I am on Flow page
    # Complete mode cycle
    When I switch from Topics and posts view to Topics only view
      And I switch from Topics only view to Topics and posts view
      And the page has re-rendered
    Then I should see the title of the first non-moderated topic
      And I should see who started the first non-moderated topic
      And I should see the comments of the first non-moderated topic

  Scenario: For a non-moderated post, collapse override is forgotten every time the mode is switched
    Given I am on Flow page
    When I click the first non-moderated topic
      And I switch from Topics and posts view to Topics only view
    # This "Then" would be the same regardless of whether it forgot
    # the override, since the override matches the new default state.
    # However, it doesn't hurt to assert it.
    Then I should see the title of the first non-moderated topic
      And I should see who started the first non-moderated topic
      And I should not see the comments of the first non-moderated topic

    When I click the first non-moderated topic
      And I switch from Topics only view to Small topics view
    Then I should see the title of the first non-moderated topic
      And I should not see who started the first non-moderated topic
      And I should not see the comments of the first non-moderated topic

    # Click it twice in a row, to test the new default state (everything
    # shows) still takes effect even though the user explicitly opened
    # and re-closed it on small topics view
    When I click the first non-moderated topic
      And I click the first non-moderated topic
      And I switch from Small topics view to Topics and posts view
    Then I should see the title of the first non-moderated topic
      And I should see who started the first non-moderated topic
      And I should see the comments of the first non-moderated topic

  Scenario: For a moderated post, a mode cycle with no user override keeps it hidden
    Given I am on Flow page
    Then I should see a moderated message on the first moderated topic
      And I should not see the title of the first moderated topic
      And I should not see who started the first moderated topic
      And I should not see the comments of the first moderated topic

    When I switch from Topics and posts view to Topics only view
    Then I should see a moderated message on the first moderated topic
      And I should not see the title of the first moderated topic
      And I should not see who started the first moderated topic
      And I should not see the comments of the first moderated topic

    When I switch from Topics only view to Small topics view
    Then I should see a moderated message on the first moderated topic
      And I should not see the title of the first moderated topic
      And I should not see who started the first moderated topic
      And I should not see the comments of the first moderated topic

    When I switch from Small topics view to Topics and posts view
    Then I should see a moderated message on the first moderated topic
      And I should not see the title of the first moderated topic
      And I should not see who started the first moderated topic
      And I should not see the comments of the first moderated topic

  Scenario: For a moderated post, switching modes does not forget a user-set close override
    Given I am on Flow page
    # First, erase the server-set close override
    When I click the first moderated topic
    Then I should see the title of the first moderated topic
      And I should see who started the first moderated topic
      And I should see the comments of the first moderated topic

    # Now, put a user-set close override
    When I click the first moderated topic
    Then I should see a moderated message on the first moderated topic
      And I should not see the title of the first moderated topic
      And I should not see who started the first moderated topic
      And I should not see the comments of the first moderated topic

    # Complete mode cycle
    When I switch from Topics and posts view to Topics only view
      And I switch from Topics only view to Topics and posts view
    Then I should see a moderated message on the first moderated topic
      And I should not see the title of the first moderated topic
      And I should not see who started the first moderated topic
      And I should not see the comments of the first moderated topic
