      "message": "I still find this confusing for a series of reasons:\n* Yes, the code below will return null then null is fed in here. But is this an intentional feature? Before, it was not (because it was not documented).\n* I don\u0027t fully understand the tests for this, as they are in .handlebars files. To me it looks like the null case is not tested.\n* The identically named JavaScript function accepts a single post ID, not an array. Is this a problem?\n* I think these IDs are integers, not strings. But I\u0027m not sure.\n\nSuggestion: Change it to \"mixed\" for now (and I will merge this), until one of the original developers of this extension can have a closer look.",
