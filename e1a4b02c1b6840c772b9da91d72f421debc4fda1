I had mistaken the change from \u0027button-method\u0027 to \u0027performs-writes\u0027 in PostActionPermissions for PostActionMenu.\n\nIf is still used in PostActionMenu, so should indeed not be removed.\n\nMy other 2 comments are also invalid; I had thought this \u0027performs-write\u0027 was used to render the links in PostActionMenu, but it is not.",
