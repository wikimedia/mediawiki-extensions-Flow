Feature: Create new topic logged in

It requires the cldr extension, a "Flow QA" page, and a "Selenium user" who has
permission to Delete (usually 'sysop'/administrator user right) and to Suppress
(usually the 'oversight' user right).
If the Selenium_user's Flow editor is VisualEditor, then the flow_page
definitions have to change.

Background:
  Given I am logged in

  @clean

      And the talk and contrib links are not visible
    When I hover over the author link
      Then links to talk and contrib should be visible

  @clean

    Then I should see a Hide button
      And I should see a Delete button
      And I should see a Suppress button
