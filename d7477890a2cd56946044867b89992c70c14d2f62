      "message": "I\u0027m not sure about this.\n\nI have a vague recollection that we would only show new topics when people watchlist a page; not replies to topics on that page. It\u0027s unclear from the Trello card if that is still the case, so this point may be moot.\n\nAlso: if we *do* want to send notifications for all replies to topics on a page a user is subscribed to, it is pointless to subscribe/unsubscribe on topic level if we are already watching the entire page (because if a person is not subscribed to the topic, he\u0027ll still get the notification because he\u0027s subscribed to the talk page)\n\n-\n\nI assume locateUsersWatchingTitle for flow-post-reply may be operating under the assumtion that this event\u0027s title is the *topic* page. However, Topic.php\u0027s setNotification() sets workflow-\u003egetOwnerTitle(), which is the talk board.\n\nThoughts?",

      "message": "As discussed per email, this is indeed not what it\u0027s supposed to do.\n\nInstead of sending a reply notification for users subscribed to the *board*, we should send it to those subscribed to a *topic*. However, when subscribing to a board, you should auto-subscribe to all new topics as well.",

      "message": "If i understand correctly, flow-post-reply should always be fired against the Topic:Rxi4ouha2sdf pages, so locateUsersWatchingTitle should notify everyone watching the topic?  There probably something I\u0027m just not seeing here.   If flow-post-reply is being fired against the parent board thats probably a separate bug to fix?",
