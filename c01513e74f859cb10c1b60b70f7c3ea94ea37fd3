      "message": "I\u0027m in doubt here. With the current patch to core to add this hook (https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/156119/), it isn\u0027t possible.\n\nI just made it pass-by-ref since I can imagine it might some day be useful for someone to add/delete pages.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how I feel about allowing more details (in this case PostRevision objects) to be passed along to core code or other hook subscribers that expects it to be a certain way. And since we already have \"the solution\" ourselves (our LocalBufferedCache) I thought that\u0027d be best.\n\nBut you\u0027re right that it\u0027s not guaranteed that LocalBufferedCache will indeed be used. It is right now, but who knows. Not sure what to best do here :p",
