    Given I am on Flow page
    When I see a flow creator element
    Then I do not see a Thank button
      And I do not see a Thanked button

  @clean @login
  Scenario: I cannot thank my own post

  # Assuming a post by another non-anon user exists
    Given I am logged in

      And I see a Thank button
    When I click on the Thank button
    Then I should see the Thank button be replaced with Thanked button
